## How to get started

**Dune is made for technical and non-technical users alike.** \
Whether you are a seasoned SQL developer or just starting out, you can use our platform to start analyzing Blockchain data in an instant.

The Dune Team and several of our community members have produced great content to aid you in your journey of becoming a Dune Wizard.

You can either start out by watching our video series [here](video-series.md) or looking through written tutorials [here](dune-guides/).\
If you are entirely unfamiliar with SQL, it might be good to start off by learning some SQL with the guides listed [here](sql-guides.md).

## What do you need to know?

#### SQL knowledge

A fundamental understanding of SQL is needed to be able to successfully query for data on Dune.\
PostgreSQL Database Systems are widely used across almost all walks of life and you can find a lot of non Dune specific documentation about it. This often times helps with answering query related questions since most answers can easily be found in the internet. The official [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/index.html) is quite helpful as well. Dune runs on PostgreSQL 12.2.

#### Ethereum Virtual Machine data

The data you will find on chain and therefore in Dune's databases is in many ways connected to understanding how the Ethereum Virtual Machine works as a whole and then in more specific terms understanding how the specific smart contracts work. If you are able to read most of the data in Etherscan, you are already well on your way to being able to query for things on dune.\
Unfortunately there really isn't one great resource we can point you to currently as each smart contract has it's own rules. We have written up a few words on this in our [Section "decoded data"](../../data-tables/data-tables/decoded-data.md).

#### Business Understanding

This is something that might come as a surprise to some of you, but actually understanding what kinds of data is interesting for your project or topic is a fundamental part of becoming a great wizard. \
\
Ask yourself: **What Data is interesting and needed for my project to make better decisions ?**

There is a thousand ways to go about finding what metrics are interesting to your project, but talking to the community of the project or the founders usually yields good results.

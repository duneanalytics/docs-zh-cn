# Ecosystem Dashboards

**Since Dune has all the data in one place you can also check more general metrics.**

## Gas Prices

You can easily assemble the data on average gas spent per tx, gas limit, gas spent in total in a block etc. using Dune.

Data on gas spent and similar metrics can also be relevant to certain protocols, so do keep this in mind.

## **DeFi Adoption**

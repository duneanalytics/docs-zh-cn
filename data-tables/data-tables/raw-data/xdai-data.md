### xDai.Logs

This Table stores all logs that get generated by smart contracts. It is sometimes useful for querying contracts that are not yet decoded or are resistant to being decoded(we need an abi key for that).

Logs are an elegant way to store tiny amounts of data on the Ethereum blockchain for a small price. Specifically, event logs are useful to let other people know something has happened without them having to query contracts individually.

### xDai.Traces

&#x20;Transactions can trigger smaller atomic actions that modify the internal state of the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Information about the execution of these actions is logged and can be found stored as an EVM execution trace, or just a _trace_.\

**You probably won’t use these too much when doing analysis with Dune (see** [**decoded data**](../decoded-data.md)**), but it’s always nice to have just in case.**

  Our database automatically pulls in raw data from the Solana Blockchain and
  parses them into different tables depending on which aspect that table is
  focused on.

# Solana Data

All of the tables below are built in an updated version of the Dune platform that will require a slight change to how wizards write queries in the platform. The new data platform leverages spark to increase query speed, data scale, and to support multi-chain queries.

A reference document to use as you start to query the Solana tables is available here:

## Solana.blocks

This table contains the block data within Solana’s blockchain. It can be used to identify block activity and transaction changes over time.

Query examples can be found here: [Solana blocks over time](https://dune.xyz/queries/389979) and [Transactions per day](https://dune.xyz/queries/390045)

## Solana.transactions

This table contains the transaction data within Solana’s blockchain. Most of the relevant data related to account, protocol, and program activity is available in this table.

### Struct definitions

Within several of these columns is a data type of STRUCT which allows for representing nested hierarchical data and has key-value pairs. It's similar to a dictionary in python and can be used to group fields together to make them more accessible.

An example of how these can be used to extract data: [# of Solana instructions by day for DEXes](https://dune.xyz/queries/416358/794290)

## Solana.vote\_transactions

This table contains the full set of vote transactions that are submitted by validators to vote on a block. It can be joined with the non-vote transactions table above to get a full breakdown of all transactions. It has the same schema as the main transactions table.

An example query that demonstrates that is available here: [Solana transactions past 30 days](https://dune.xyz/queries/389976/743760)

## Solana.rewards

This table contains data about rewards paid out on Solana. One block may contain zero or more rewards, and each row corresponds to one reward.

An example query can be found here: [Solana rewards fee per day](https://dune.xyz/queries/391421/747012)

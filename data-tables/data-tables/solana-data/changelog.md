# Changelog

### 2022-03-25

the `solana.account_activity` table has been updated to a new version. The new version of the table contains additional information around token activity. The following columns were added to the table:

* `pre_token_balances`
  * The token balance before the transaction was processed
* `post_token_balances`
  * The token balance after the transaction was processed
* `token_balance_changes`
  * The balance change that occurred as part of the transaction

### 2022-03-18

Released the `solana.account_activity` table that contains all of the information about an account’s usage in a transaction.

The table is optimized to run with ‘WHERE address = …’ queries

### 2022-03-01

The `solana.transactions` table has now been upgraded to a new version. The new version of the table uses cleaner array structs to make it easier to extract useful information.&#x20;

The vote transactions have also been split into their own table `solana.vote_transactions`, so queries using `solana.transactions` will have better performance. Unfortunately, the table change also means that some existing queries will now break and need to be changed.

What this means for your existing queries using `solana.transactions`:

* You won't need to check if a transaction is a vote transaction, which has typically been done with `WHERE ARRAY_CONTAINS(account_keys, "Vote111111111111111111111111111111111111111") = false`
* The `error_index` and `error_message` columns have been removed, and have been merged into the `error` column (which is a struct). So now instead of `WHERE error_index is not null`, a query should do `WHERE error is not null`.
* Structs containing indexes to `account_keys` now include the account address directly, so there is no need to use the `account_keys` column to look up the account addresses:

```
before                                             	->  now
account_keys[instructions[i]['program_id_index']]  	->  instructions[i].executing_account
account_keys[pre_token_balances[i]['account_index']]   ->  pre_token_balances[i].account
account_keys[post_token_balances[i]['account_index']]  ->  post_token_balances[i].account
```

* The `pre_token_balances` and `post_token_balances` columns have changed. The token balance is now included in the field `amount`. And as mentioned above, the struct in the array now has a field `account`, which is the account of the token balance.
* The `instructions` column has changed. As mentioned above, the struct in the array now has a field `executing_account`, which is the account executing the instruction.
* The `inner_instructions` column is removed, and inner instructions have been moved into the `instructions` column.

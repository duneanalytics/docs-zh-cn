### Attribution

Content on Dune is first and foremost the product of the creators on the platform. \
Any mention of analysis published on our platform outside of the platform should credit the creators of this specific piece of analysis and not just "Dune". \
\
Crediting charts and dashboards should be done in the following way:

_"@eliasmos via_ [_https://dune.com/queries/610591_](https://dune.com/queries/610591)_"._

You can find the twitter tags and more information of most creators in their [profile page](https://dune.xyz/rchen8).

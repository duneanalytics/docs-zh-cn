  Sharing data on Twitter is probably the most common use case of Dune's

# Twitter

You can use embeds to share Dune's visualizations on Twitter.

Twitter will render the visualizations automatically and they will update automatically  as time progresses.&#x20;

Definitely a better experience compared to static screenshots!
